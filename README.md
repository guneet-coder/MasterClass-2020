 2. The instructor would go over the content of the hands-on session and thereafter if instructor wish, then participants would be divided into smaller groups (called breakout rooms) to work on the exercises of the jupyter notebook for 20-30 mins and during last 10-15 mins the the participants would come back to main room and instructor would discuss about exercise solutions or difficulties.
  3. In the breakout rooms, the discussion between the participants is encouraged to work collaboratively. The data scientist team members would be visiting the breakout room on round robin basis to assist you in the breakout rooms. 

## Asking questions during Zoom Lab
 - For assistance with the content or a technical issue in the breakout room, you can unmute your microphone and speak to other participant in your breakout room (Also feel free to type messages in the Zoom chat).
- To request immediate assistance you can use **Slack Channel** to ask the questions if no one from Sabudh foundation team is around you 
- You can also click "Ask for Help" on Zoom client app would send notification to the Instructor of the Zoom meeting.
- Please note that the instructor may be busy attending other requests at that time. If your request is accepted, then a data scientist will be alerted and join your breakout room as soon as they are available.
